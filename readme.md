  <p>
    Writeup is a text markup format that translates to HTML5. It is similar to Markdown in spirit, but not equivalent. Some differences:
  </p>
  <ul class="L1">
    <li>Writeup documents can embed the contents of other files, with sensible default styling.</li>
    <li>Writeup has unambiguous character escape syntaxes.</li>
    <li>The output HTML document is organized into hierarchical sections.</li>
    <li>An optional lightweight presentation mode (implemented with embedded JavaScript) makes Writeup useful for simple technical slide decks.</li>
    <li>A required syntax version at the top of every Writeup document allows the format to evolve while preserving the ability to render older documents exactly as originally intended.</li>
    <li>Special handling of copyright/license header lines.</li>
    <li>Integration with <a href="https://gwk.github.io/muck">Muck</a>, a build tool for data projects.</li>
  </ul>

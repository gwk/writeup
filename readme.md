  <p>
    Writeup is a text markup format that translates to HTML5. It is similar to Markdown in spirit, but is not equivalent. Some differences:
  </p>
  <ul class="L1">
    <li>Hierarchical sections.</li>
    <li>Unambiguous character escape syntaxes.</li>
    <li>Built in Javascript presentation mode.</li>
    <li>A line-oriented syntax designed to make correct implementation simple and unambiguous.</li>
    <li>A versioning scheme that should allow for format evolution while preserving the ability to build old source files.</li>
    <li>Special handling of leading version and license lines.</li>
    <li>Integration with <a href=https:github.com/gwk/muck>Muck</a>, a build tool for data projects.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The project is hosted at <a href=https:github.com/gwk/writeup>https:github.com/gwk/writeup</a>, with documentation at <a href=https:gwk.github.io/writeup>https:gwk.github.io/writeup</a>.

# Writeup

Writeup is a text markup format that translates to HTML5. It is similar to Markdown in spirit, but is not equivalent. Some differences:
* Hierarchical sections.
* Unambiguous character escape syntaxes.
* Built in Javascript presentation mode.
* A line-oriented syntax designed to make correct implementation simple and unambiguous.
* A versioning scheme that should allow for format evolution while preserving the ability to build old source files.
* Special handling of leading version and license lines.
* Integration with [https:github.com/gwk/muck](Muck), a build tool for data projects.

The project is hosted at https:github.com/gwk/writeup.
